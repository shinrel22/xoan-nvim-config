This is a nvim config example

## Key map features

I try to avoid C-<key> combinations for the things I do frequently, mapping things that make sense to the `<leader>` key. The
[leader key](http://usevim.com/2012/07/20/vim101-leader/) provides a facility for creating customized shortcuts that can be further restricted to apply only in certain modes, such as normal, insert, visual, terminal (neovim-specific), etc.

The leader key is normally defined by the `mapleader` variable as `\`. Many people like to redefine it to `,`. I prefer
`;` since it sits right under my right pinkie.
